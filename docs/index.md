## What is RestBook?

RestBook is a powerful API request orchestration tool that lets you define and execute complex REST API workflows using declarative YAML playbooks. Unlike API testing tools, RestBook **isn't about testing** endpoints one by oneâ€”it's designed to chain together multiple API calls, manage state between requests, and even resume workflows after failures.

### Key Features

- **YAML-Based Playbooks**: Define your API workflows in simple, readable YAML files
- **Session Management**: Configure and reuse API sessions with authentication
- **Phased Execution**: Organize requests into logical phases
- **Variable Management**: Store and reuse data between requests
- **Template Rendering**: Use variables in requests with template syntax
- **Parallel Execution**: Run requests in parallel for improved performance
- **Incremental Execution**: Resume playbooks from checkpoints
- **Resilient HTTP Client**: Automatic retries, circuit breaking, and rate limiting
- **Metrics Collection**: Monitor and analyze playbook performance
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add custom authentication and checkpoint stores
