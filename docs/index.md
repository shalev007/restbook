## What is RestBook?

RestBook is a powerful API request orchestration tool that lets you define and execute complex REST API workflows using declarative YAML playbooks. Unlike API testing tools, RestBook **isn't about testing** endpoints one by oneâ€”it's designed to chain together multiple API calls, manage state between requests, and even resume workflows after failures.

### Key Features

- **YAML-Based Playbooks**: Define your API workflows in simple, readable YAML files
- **Session Management**: Reuse authenticated sessions across requests with support for environment variables
- **Parallel Execution**: Run steps and iterations concurrently for improved performance
- **Response Processing**: Extract and store data from responses using JQ queries
- **Variable System**: Store and reuse data between steps with Jinja2 templating
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize retry policies, SSL verification, and error handling
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of requests, responses, and operations
- **CI/CD Ready**: Support for environment variables in configuration
